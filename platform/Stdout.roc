## **BrokenPipe** - This error can occur when writing to a stdout that is no longer connected 
## to a valid input. For example, if the process on the receiving end of a pipe closes its
## end, any write to that pipe could lead to a BrokenPipe error.
##
## **WouldBlock** - This error might occur if stdout is set to non-blocking mode and the write
## operation would block because the output buffer is full.
##
## **WriteZero** - This indicates an attempt to write "zero" bytes which is technically a no-operation
## (no-op), but if detected, it could be raised as an error.
##
## **Unsupported** - If the stdout operation involves writing data in a manner or format that is not
## supported, this error could be raised.
##
## **Interrupted** - This can happen if a signal interrupts the writing process before it completes.
##
## **OutOfMemory** - This could occur if there is not enough memory available to buffer the data being
## written to stdout.
##
## **Other** - This is a catch-all for any error not specifically categorized by the other ErrorKind 
## variants.
